# express-playground

This is a playground, where I experiment with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/). As this repo grows, there will be many dependencies added, perhaps too many. But it's better than creating lots of projects. You know `node_module` is the heaviest object in the universeðŸ™ƒ.<br>

This repo managed using [bun](https://bun.sh/).

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun dev
```
### Non bun user
If you don't use bun, change the configuration to your condition. You can use nodemon, tsx, etc.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.25. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
